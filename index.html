<p>Hello, I'm Josh. I attended Warren Hills High School in Washington, New Jersey. My hobbies are listening 
to music and playing video games. I've also been playing saxophone for about 10 years. Throughout high school, I 
took numerous computer science classes and participated in many 'capture the flag' cybersecurity competitions.
I was the first chair saxophone player for my high school jazz ensemble, the section leader for marching band, 
and an active member of my school's pit orchestra. Here at RIT, I plan to minor in Cybersecurity, and 
I'm also considering a minor in Physics. </p>


<p>My favorite food is pizza!</p>
